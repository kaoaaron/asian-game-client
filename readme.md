- use node 22 for consistency
- https://github.com/kaoaaron/AsianAPI/blob/main/readme.md for endpoint usage
- runs on port 3000 with npm run start

To run locally, create a .env.development file and store this:
`REACT_APP_ASIAN_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"`

To run with production api, create .env.local, and create the same variable, but with the prod API URL (ask Aaron if you don't know)
